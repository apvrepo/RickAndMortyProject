# Rick & Morty API Project

This project is an integration with the Rick and Morty API, a REST-based service that provides access to a vast collection of characters, images, locations, and episodes from the popular television show Rick and Morty. The API contains canonical information directly sourced from the series, ensuring accuracy and consistency with the show's universe.

As part of this integration, users can select their favorite character, which is then stored and automatically retrieved upon accessing their specific User Record Page. This feature enhances personalization by allowing users to engage with their preferred characters seamlessly within the platform.
